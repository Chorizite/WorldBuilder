# Contributing to WorldBuilder

We welcome contributions from the community! Thank you for helping make this project better.

## Quick Links

- **Discord**: [Join #worldbuilder](https://discord.gg/WgwMMCB4Ny) for quick questions and discussion
- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports, feature requests, and detailed technical discussions

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch for your changes
4. Make your changes
5. Submit a pull request

**Important**: All changes must be made in a new branch. Never commit directly to the master branch.

## Before You Start

### New Features or Functionality Changes

**Please create an issue first!** Before investing time in development:

1. Open a GitHub issue or discuss on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WgwMMCB4Ny)
2. Describe the problem you're solving and your proposed solution
3. Wait for maintainer feedback
4. Once there's agreement, start working on it

This prevents duplicate work and ensures your contribution aligns with the project's direction.

### Bug Fixes

Bug fixes can be submitted directly as pull requests. If you want to discuss your approach first, feel free to open an issue or chat on Discord.

### Claiming an Issue

To work on an existing issue:

1. Comment on the issue or message on Discord
2. Wait for a maintainer to assign it to you
3. This helps prevent duplicate work

## Code Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow the `.editorconfig` settings (your IDE should pick these up automatically)
- Fix all warnings before submitting your PR
- Keep code clean and readable
- Add XML Doc comments for public APIs

### Testing

- Write tests that cover your changes
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Run the full test suite before submitting
- While new tests are highly encouraged, they aren't strictly required for minor changes

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Scope and Size

- Keep changes focused and isolated—one feature or bug fix per PR
- Avoid large, sweeping changes without prior discussion
- Break large features into smaller, reviewable PRs

### Before Submitting

Verify that:

- [ ] Your branch is up-to-date with the main branch
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] All CI/CD checks pass
- [ ] All linting warnings are fixed
- [ ] You've added tests for your changes

### Submission Process

1. Push your changes to your fork
2. Open a pull request against the main branch
3. Fill out the PR description (what changed and why)
4. Wait for maintainer review
5. Address any feedback or requested changes
6. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

**Note**: All PRs are squash-merged, so individual commit messages aren't critical.

### Draft Pull Requests

Consider opening a draft PR early if you want feedback before completing all work. This can save time and ensure you're on the right track.

## Review Process

- Pull requests are reviewed by project maintainers
- Please be patient—maintainers may be busy, but we value your contribution
- Response times are faster on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WgwMMCB4Ny) than GitHub Issues
